The storage system involves a glass storage container with a recyclable plastic lid. 
The lid has a slot for the refillable cartridge to be screwed in and out for cleaning the container easily as the customer is accustomed to.  
The refillable cartridge is defined by a patent-pending two chamber system, testing for volatile compounds, which are gasses released by food and bacteria as the food decays.
The container has been shown through our customer testing to reduce food waste for the avergae consumer of the product by 30%.
The average food waste by each American household (size 4), according to studies by William & Maryâ€™s Department of Kinesiology & Health Sciences and the USDA, is $1300 to $1600.
This means the system for an household could reduce the cost by $390 to $480 per year.
With an initial cost of $35 the system is an affordable option for saving food waste while being envioronmentally sustainable by adding minimal amounts to plastic pollution while reducing food waste.
